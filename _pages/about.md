I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [Prof. Sicun Gao](https://scungao.github.io) at department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu), UC San Diego. I obtained my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematical sciences from Seoul National University, Korea, in 2012 and 2018, respectively. My advisor was [Prof. Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/).

<br> My research interests include security, privacy, and advanced cryptography. My current research focuses on the design, optimization, and applications of Homomorphic Encryption.

<br> I am the main developer of HEAAN which is an homomorphic encryption scheme with native support for fixed-point approximate arithmetic.

## What's NEW
  * Our team (UCSD) won the second track (Homomorphic Encryption) of iDASH Privacy and Security Competition 2018. [[URL]](http://www.humangenomeprivacy.org/2018/) [[overall results]](https://yongsoosong.github.io/images/idash18_track2.jpg)
  * I am giving an invited talk at [ECC 2018](https://cy2sec.comm.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp/ecc2018/index.html) (Nov 2018).
  * I will join the [cryptographic group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cryptography-research/) of Microsoft Research, Redmond, as a researcher.
