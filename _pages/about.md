I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [Prof. Sicun Gao](https://scungao.github.io) at department of Computer Science and Engineering, UC San Diego. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in mathematics in 2018 from Seoul National University, Korea (Advisor: [Prof. Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/)). I obtained my bachelor's degree from Seoul National University in 2012.

<br><br> My research interests include security, privacy, and advanced cryptography. My main research focuses on the design, optimization, and applications of Homomorphic Encryption.
