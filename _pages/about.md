I am a researcher in the [Cryptography Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cryptography-research/) at Microsoft Research, Redmond.
My research focus is on security, privacy, and advanced cryptography. Currently I am very interested in design, optimization, and applications of Homomorphic Encryption.

I obtained my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematical sciences from Seoul National University, Korea, in 2012 and 2018, respectively. My advisor was [Prof. Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/).
I have been a postdoctoral researcher hosted by [Prof. Sicun Gao](https://scungao.github.io) at UC San Diego prior to joining Microsoft.

In 2016, I invented the [[CKKS]](https://yongsoosong.github.io/files/papers/HEAAN.pdf) scheme, which is a homomorphic encryption scheme supporting approximate fixed-point arithmetic.
An implementation of its [[RNS variant]](https://yongsoosong.github.io/files/papers/RNS.pdf) (with some minor changes from the paper) is publicly available in [[Microsoft SEAL]](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-seal/) under MIT license.
