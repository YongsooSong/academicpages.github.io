I am a researcher in the [Cryptography Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cryptography-research/) at Microsoft Research, Redmond.
My research focus is on cryptographic primitives for secure computation. My recent researches focus on design, optimization, and application of [Homomorphic Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption).

I obtained my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematical sciences from Seoul National University, Korea, in 2012 and 2018, respectively. My advisor was [Prof. Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/).
I have been a postdoctoral researcher hosted by [Prof. Sicun Gao](https://scungao.github.io) at UC San Diego prior to joining Microsoft.

In 2016, I invented a Homomorphic Encryption for Arithmetic of Approximate Numbers (HEAAN, aka CKKS).
There are several open-source libraries including HEAAN(https://github.com/snucrypto/HEAAN) and [Microsoft SEAL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-seal/).
